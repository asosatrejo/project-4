Python Pandas is used for data cleaning, data transformation, and data export. This is indicated by the Python code snippets showing functions like drop_duplicates() and to_csv(), which are part of the Pandas library.
SQL Database storage is indicated, with a screenshot showing the use of sqlite3 in Python to store data in an SQL database. This is further evidenced by SQL code that creates and interacts with a table named air_quality_data.
Data Cleaning and Transformation steps are shown, involving the removal of duplicate records and conversion of data types, which are common tasks in data preprocessing.
Data Export to a CSV file is demonstrated. This is a common step after cleaning and transforming data, making it ready for analysis or machine learning.
Database Storage is shown with SQLite, which is a lightweight, file-based database system often used for prototyping and smaller projects.
Feature Engineering is mentioned as a step in the data preprocessing phase, which is an essential part of preparing data for machine learning models.
